# Buildpack Samples [![Build Status](https://github.com/buildpacks/samples/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/buildpacks/samples/actions)

This repository contains sample implementations of the core components of the Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNB) project for learning and testing purposes.

Includes:

- [Apps](apps/README.MD)
- [Buildpacks](buildpacks/README.md)
- [Builders](builders/README.MD)
- [Stacks](stacks/README.md)
- [Packages](packages/README.md)


### Start here:

To get up and running, [install `pack`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/install-pack/) and run `make build-linux` or `make build-windows`, depending on your choice of target OS.
Follow the `README.MD` docs at the root directory of each component to choose your next step. We recommend starting to play with building [apps](apps/README.MD).
